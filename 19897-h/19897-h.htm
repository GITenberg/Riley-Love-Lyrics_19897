AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE<br /></h2>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I turn the leaves of fancy till, in shadowy design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tis a fragrant retrospection&mdash;for the loving thoughts that start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voices of my children, and the mother as she sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I find an extra flavor in Memory's mellow wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the written declaration that, "as surely as the vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew round the stump," she loved me&mdash;that old sweetheart of mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we used to talk together of the future we had planned&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But write the tender verses that she set the music to:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When we should live together in a cozy little cot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I should be her lover forever and a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we should be so happy that when either's lips were dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would not smile in Heaven till the other's kiss had come.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the door is softly opened, and&mdash;my wife is standing there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Whenever I hear that old song<br /></span>

<span class="i2">My life seems as short as it's long!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer ev'rything 'pears like adzackly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It 'peared in the years past and gone,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I started out sparkin', at twenty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And had my first neckercher on!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And I'm jest a youngster again!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm a-standin' back thare in the furries<br /></span>

<span class="i2">It reminds me of her, don't you know;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How her face used to look, in the twilight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As I tuck her to Spellin'; and she<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then the glad chirp of the crickets,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As clear as the twitter of birds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dust in the road is like velvet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ragweed and fennel and grass<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How tired I am! I sink down all alone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here by the wayside of the Present. Lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as a child I hide my face and moan&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A little girl that may no farther go;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The path above me only seems to grow<br /></span>
<span class="i4">More rugged, climbing still, and ever briered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With keener thorns of pain than these below;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And O the bleeding feet that falter so<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And are so very tired!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why, I have journeyed from the far-off Lands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Babyhood&mdash;where baby-lilies blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their trumpets in mine ears, and filled my hands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With treasures of perfume and honey-dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And where the orchard shadows ever drew<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Their cool arms round me when my cheeks were fired<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With too much joy, and lulled mine eyelids to,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And only let the starshine trickle through<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In sprays, when I was tired!<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet I remember, when the butterfly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went flickering about me like a flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That quenched itself in roses suddenly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How oft I wished that <i>I</i> might blaze the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in some rose-wreath nestle with my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While all the world looked on it and admired.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor moth!&mdash;Along my wavering flight toward fame<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The winds drive backward, and my wings are lame<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And broken, bruised and tired!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I hardly know the path from those old times;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know at first it was a smoother one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this that hurries past me now, and climbs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So high, its far cliffs even hide the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shroud in gloom my journey scarce begun.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I could not do quite all the world required&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I could not do quite all I should have done,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in my eagerness I have outrun<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My strength&mdash;and I am tired....<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For long ago they left me in my need,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To woo me on, with many a glimmering rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rained from the golden rim of some fair clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That, hovering beyond the clouds, inspired<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My failing heart with fancies so sublime<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Went laughing o'er my shoulders gleefully<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And scattering my love-songs far behind;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until, at last, I thought the world so kind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So rich in all my yearning soul desired&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So generous&mdash;so loyally inclined,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He called her in from me and shut the door.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She loved them even better yet than I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ne'er knew dearth of them&mdash;my mother dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature had nursed me in her lap instead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I had grown a dark and eerie child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rarely smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when, shut all alone in grasses high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking straight up in God's great lonesome sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coaxing Mother to smile back on me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas lying thus, this fair girl suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to me, nestled in the fields beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pleasant-seeming home, with doorway wide&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like golden rain.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O sweet, sweet face above me, turn again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave me! I had cried, but that an ache<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within my throat so gripped it I could make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt her light hand laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my hair&mdash;a touch that ne'er before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed the touch the children used to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Christ was here, so dear it was&mdash;so dear,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once I loved her as the leaves love dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In midmost summer when the days are new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barely an hour I knew her, yet a curl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silken sunshine did she clip for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the bright May-morning of her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bound and gave it to me laughingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught my hands and called me <i>"Little girl,"</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tiptoeing, as she spoke, to kiss me there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I stood dazed and dumb for very stress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my great happiness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raiment&mdash;drew me with her everywhere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then straightway before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vision that is with me evermore:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heeds not any voice nor fall of tears.&mdash;<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
